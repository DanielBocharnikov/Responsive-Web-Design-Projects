						<p class="section__text">
							Ivan Konstantinovich Aivazovsky (Russian: Иван Константинович
							Айвазовский; 29 July 1817 – 2 May 1900) was a Russian Romantic
							painter. Baptized as Hovhannes Aivazian, he was born into an
							Armenian family in the Black Sea port of Feodosia in Crimea and
							was mostly based there.
						</p>
						<p class="section__text">
							Following his education at the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint
							Petersburg, Aivazovsky traveled to Europe and lived briefly in
							Italy in the early 1840s. He then returned to Russia and was
							appointed the main painter of the Russian Navy. Aivazovsky had
							close ties with the military and political elite of the Russian
							Empire and often attended military maneuvers. He was sponsored by
							the state and was well-regarded during his lifetime. The saying
							"worthy of Aivazovsky's brush", popularized by Anton Chekhov, was
							used in Russia for describing something lovely. He remains highly
							popular in Russia in the 21st century.
						</p>
						<p class="section__text">
							Aivazovsky was also popular outside Russia. He held numerous solo
							exhibitions in Europe and the United States. During his almost
							60-year career, he created around 6,000 paintings, making him one
							of the most prolific artists of his time. The vast majority of his
							works are seascapes, but he often depicted battle scenes, Armenian
							themes, and portraiture. Most of Aivazovsky's works are kept in
							Russian, Ukrainian and Armenian museums as well as private
							collections.

						<h2 class="section__title">His Legacy</h2>
						<p class="section__text">
							During his 60-year career, Aivazovsky produced around 6,000
							paintings of, what one online art magazine describes,
							<q
								>very different value ... there are masterpieces and there are
								very timid works</q
							>. However, according to one count as many as 20,000 paintings are
							attributed to him. The vast majority of Aivazovsky's works depict
							the sea. He rarely drew dry-landscapes and created only a handful
							of portraits. According to Rosa Newmarch Aivazovsky
							<q
								>never painted his pictures from nature, always from memory, and
								far away from the seaboard.</q
							>
							Rogachevsky wrote that
							<q
								>His artistic memory was legendary. He was able to reproduce
								what he had seen only for a very short time, without even
								drawing preliminary sketches.</q
							>
							Bolton praised
							<q
								>his ability to convey the effect of moving water and of
								reflected sun and moonlight.</q
							>
						</p>
						<p class="section__text">
							He was the most influential seascape painter in nineteenth-century
							Russian art. According to the Russian Museum,
							<q
								>he was the first and for a long time the only representative of
								seascape painting</q
							>
							and
							<q
								>all other artists who painted seascapes were either his own
								students or influenced by him.</q
							>
						</p>
						<p class="section__text">
							Ivan Aivazovsky is one of the few Russian artists to achieve wide
							recognition during his lifetime. Today, he is considered as one of
							the most prominent marine artists of the 19th century, and,
							overall, one of the greatest marine artists in Russia and the
							world. Aivazovsky was also one of the few Russian artists to
							become famous outside Russia. In 1898, Munsey's Magazine wrote
							that Aivazovsky is
							<q
								>better known to the world at large than any other artist of his
								nationality, with the exception of the sensational
								Verestchagin</q
							>. However, according to art historian Janet Whitmore he is
							relatively unknown in the west. Art historian Rosalind Polly
							Blakesley noted in a 2003 book review that Aivazovsky has not been
							incorporated into the mainstream Western history of art.
						</p>
						<p class="section__text">
							Aivazovsky's house in Feodosia, where he had founded an art museum
							in 1880, is open to this day as the Aivazovsky National Art
							Gallery. It remains a central attraction in the city and holds the
							world's largest collections (417) of Aivazovsky paintings. A
							statue of the artist stands in front.
